Introduction  
    Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in electric vehicles. Because automobiles require a high power density and high capacity, battery cells are typically connected in series to form a battery module. For the battery module, the single cells are potentially exposed to overcharge or over-discharge during charge–discharge cycling due to the unbalanced state of charge (SOC) in constituent cells in the module, which leads to serious battery deterioration and can be a trigger of combustion and explosion. To guarantee the battery safety, the development of non-destructive analysis to identify LIBs is mandatory.  
    Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most effective methods for understanding the internal status of the battery cell without any cell destruction. In this project, we investigate the effect of charge-discharge cycling conditions on the capacity of LIBs and analyze the battery degradation using EIS measurement to propose the appropriate method for diagnosing batteries.
